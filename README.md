### Login & Register

You can login and register with the `/login` and `/register` endpoints.

You have some verifications when logging in or registering:

- Your password is at least 8 characters long, with numbers, uppercases and lowercases

Here are the `/login` and `/register` pages, and an example of an error message if some fields are wrong:
